# Concept: skills

**Read this when:** you're writing or adapting a Pi skill for a job kind.
**Skip if:** you need the shared extension's tools instead — see
`contract-extension.md`.

## Skills per job kind (ADR 004, `spec_grill` split by ADR 008)

| Job kind | Skill | Location |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `spec_grill` — a project's very first run | `project-init` | `spec_grill/skills/project-init/SKILL.md` |
| `spec_grill` — every other feature | `feature-grill` | `spec_grill/skills/feature-grill/SKILL.md` |
| `feature_build` | `implement` | `feature_build/skills/implement/SKILL.md` |
| `test_run` | `run-tests` | `test_run/skills/run-tests/SKILL.md` |
| `agentic_review` | `review` | `agentic_review/skills/review/SKILL.md` |
| `design_grill` | `design-grill` | `design_grill/skills/design-grill/SKILL.md` |

`script_test_run` has **no skill** — it is the deliberately non-agent job kind
(ADR 015): a plain container that runs the project's own `test-unit.sh` /
`test-integration.sh` scripts and writes the canonical
`.yggdrasil/test-report.json`. See `script_test_run/entrypoint.sh`.

`spec_grill` is the one job kind with two skills installed side by side
(ADR 008 items 2-5): the Orchestrator's initial prompt names exactly one of
them per run (`buildInitialPrompt` branches on `FeatureSpec.FeatureType`,
`orchestrator/internal/worker/specgrill.go`) — never left to the model to
infer which applies from the feature title. `project-init` also carries a
bundled reference doc (`spec_grill/skills/project-init/reference/`) it
grills the target repo against — see `docs/adr/008-project-init-grill-and-submodule-repos.md`
in the meta repo.

Each `SKILL.md` restricts its visible tools via the `allowed-tools`
frontmatter field, scoped to the subset of `yggdrasil-contract`'s tools that
job kind actually needs — e.g. both spec_grill skills only see `ask_user` and
`submit_adr`, never `submit_build_result`.

## Conventions all skills share

- **Never call a tool outside the shared extension for turn/completion
  signaling.** Plain text is not a supported way to ask the user something or
  end a run — see `contract-extension.md` for why.
- **Input arrives as a file under `/workspace/.yggdrasil/`**, not as a CLI
  argument or chat message — `adr.md` for `implement`, `test-spec.md` for
  `run-tests`. This is an assumption about the Orchestrator's job-dispatch
  implementation, documented in each skill's own file — verify against the
  actual Orchestrator code once that side lands, and fix the skill (not just
  the assumption note) if it's wrong.
- **Don't create git branches.** The Orchestrator checks out the right branch
  or ref before the container's skill ever runs.

## Editing a skill

`SKILL.md` frontmatter and discovery follow Pi's own skill system (directory
with `SKILL.md`, optional `allowed-tools`/`disable-model-invocation`, bundled
scripts under e.g. `./scripts/`). These are baked into the image at build time
via each Dockerfile's `COPY`, not mounted at runtime.
